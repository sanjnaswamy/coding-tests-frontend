Some comments / information 
- As suggested, I have tried to use tailwind classes to style the page and used minimal custom CSS. Hence, the colours are not 100% accurate. We could make use of hex or rgba color codes in custom CSS to achieve this.
- In some cases of font sizes I have used the nearest available value through tailwind class to match the Figma design. (In order to avoid writing custom CSS).
- 768 to 992 has been considered as the tablet view along with given breakpoints for a defined responsive behaviour.
- Due to time shortage, I have tried my best to include as many elements as possible. Focused on js behaviours on priority to showcase my skills.
- The hamburger implementation has been done. And the addition of classes 'mobile' and 'tablet' for all buttons has also been addressed.
- If time permitted, I can complete the assignment and update the same.
- Thank you for your consideration.
